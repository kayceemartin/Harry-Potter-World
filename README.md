## User Stories
>As a user, I want to see a home page where I will be sorted into a house. Afterwards, I want to see the possible characters in the house I was placed in. As a user I would like to click on each character’s card to see facts about each character. 

### MVP Goals
>I would like to have a home page with a one question quiz. How you answer that question will then bring you to your house common room where three characters appear. By clicking on each character you are then given information about that character. 

### Stretch Goals
>I would like to add a login in feature and a multi-question quiz to be sorted into a house. I would also like to have a button in each Common Room that you can take "polyjuice potion" and see another house's common room.
