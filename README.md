## User Stories
>As a user, I want to see a home page where I will be sorted into a house. Afterwards, I want to see the possible characters in the house I was placed in. As a user I would like to click on each characterâ€™s card to see facts about each character. 

### MVP Goals
>I would like to have a home page with a one question quiz. How you answer that question will then bring you to your house common room where three characters appear. By clicking on each character you are then given information about that character. 

### Stretch Goals
>I would like to add a search bar feature where you can search for any character and a multi-question quiz to be sorted into a house. I would also like to have a button in each Common Room that you can take "polyjuice potion" and see another house's common room.  

### Getting Started
>When opening up the app, you'll see the home page where you can be sorted into a house. You will also see a search bar feature where you can search for any Harry Potter character. In order to run the application, be sure to fork it into your own Github account, clone the code, and in your terminal run "npm start".

### Contribution Guidelines
>Before contributing code, or adding features, be sure you have forked and clone the original code. Once that has been done, feel free to add on and tackle some of the above stretch goals!
